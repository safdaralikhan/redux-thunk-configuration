
REDUX THHUNK

first install redux 
then install react-redux
then redux-thunk

create redux structure

store.js code
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import rootReducer from './reducers/RootReducer'

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))

export default store

ACTION.JS
//Action Types
export const SEARCHDATA = "SEARCHDATA";


//Action Creator
export const updateForm = (data) => ({

    // console.log("data",data)
    type: SEARCHDATA,
    payload:data
});

Reducer.js
import { SEARCHDATA } from '../actions/ActionFunction';



const counterReducer = (state = { searchdata: {} }, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case SEARCHDATA:

            console.log("action.payload",action.payload)
            return { ...state, searchdata: action.payload };
    
        default:
            return { ...state };
    }
};



 export default counterReducer


ROOTREDUCER.JS

import counterReducer from './CountReducer';
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    counter: counterReducer
});

export default rootReducer;


TO GET DATA FROM REDUX USESELECTOR :
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'; 
  const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter)
